### Kind Reminder

This extension was developed because the [official one](https://github.com/madskristensen/FileDiffer) was missing many features I need at that time, and I also wanted to learn
how to write a Visual Studio extension. Since the official one has added almost all the missing features, I recommend everyone to give preference to that extension and use this
extension only when the official one does not work for you. Refer to blog [comparing files in visual studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/comparing-files-in-visual-studio).

## Features

- Compare two selected files in Solution Explorer (Folder View supported).

I may not be able to reply to you directly in the marketplace.
