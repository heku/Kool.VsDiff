## Thanks

Thanks for every rating, I'm glad the tool is helpful to you,
because of a [network issue](https://github.com/heku/Kool.VsDiff/issues/5),
I cannot reply to you directly in the marketplace.

## Welcome

I'm not a native English speaker, so if you could correct any grammer mistake, it would be very appreciated.
